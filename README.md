# Stock Price Prediction Model with LSTM and Dense Layers

## Introduction
This repository contains a stock price prediction model using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network with additional dense layers. The model is built using popular Python libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, NumPy, pandas, and Keras. The historical stock price data is obtained from the Tingoo API, and the predictions are visualized using Matplotlib.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
To run this project, you'll need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- pandas
- Keras
- Matplotlib

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn tensorflow numpy pandas keras matplotlib
```

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction-model.git
cd stock-price-prediction
```

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>
This project is designed for stock price prediction. Follow these steps to use it:

1. Extract historical stock price data using the Tingoo API.
2. Build and train the LSTM model with dense layers.
3. Make stock price predictions.
4. Visualize the predictions using Matplotlib.

Detailed steps for each of these processes are provided below.

## Data Extraction <a name="data-extraction"></a>
To obtain historical stock price data, you can use the Tingoo API or any other source of your choice. Ensure that you have access to the necessary API key or credentials. Implement the data extraction logic in a Python script and save the data as a CSV file for training and testing the model.

## Model Architecture <a name="model-architecture"></a>
The stock price prediction model consists of the following layers:

1. LSTM layer(s) for sequential data analysis.
2. Dense layer(s) for feature extraction and prediction.
3. Output layer for predicting stock prices.

You can customize the architecture by adjusting the number of LSTM and dense layers, as well as the number of neurons in each layer, based on your requirements.

## Training <a name="training"></a>
To train the model, use the historical stock price data saved as a CSV file. Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. Adjust hyperparameters such as batch size and epochs for training the model. After training, save the trained model weights for future use.

## Prediction <a name="prediction"></a>
Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new or unseen data. Prepare the input data in the same format as the training data and use the trained model to predict future stock prices.

## Visualization <a name="visualization"></a>
Visualize the model's predictions and compare them to the actual stock prices using Matplotlib. This step helps you evaluate the model's accuracy and provides insights into its performance.
